# CNN-based Pokedex

### REMINDER:
I had used this algorithm to create a pokedex (something out of the cartoon show called Pokemon). However, this code can be used as a common object detector or classifier if you use the right dataset.   

### :cd: Dataset
* Create your own dataset that will have more than 200 pictures for each category you want to detect to get accurate results.

### :key: Run the Code
* Save file as classify.py
* Download the contents of this repository and put it in the local directory.
* In this directory, make sure to make your own .model file to store the model after training it on your dataset.
* Open code file in the directory containing the dataset and run it.

### :books: Libraries Used
* Numpys
* sklearn
* tensorflow
* cnnmodel
* CV2
* matplotlib
* imutils
* pickle
